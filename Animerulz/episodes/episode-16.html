            &nbsp;Naruto and Sasuke continue to receive punishing attacks from
            within Haku's Crystal Ice Mirrors. Naruto can no longer stand on his
            feet. But during the intense battle, Sasuke starts to realize the
            power of his own Sharingan and gradually starts to elude Haku's
            assault. Haku decides to finish them off immediately. Sasuke is
            caught off guard by Haku's action and uses his own body to shield
            Naruto...
