            &nbsp;Sakura goes into town with Tazuna and sees the hardships that
            the people of the Land of Waves suffer under Gato's rule. This is
            the reason Tazuna is risking his life to build a bridge that crosses
            the ocean. With a bridge that gives everyone access to other lands,
            people will no longer have to rely on Gato, who controls all
            imports. Meanwhile, Naruto and Sasuke continue to train, using
            chakra to climb a tree.
