            &nbsp; Naruto and his squad start their first ninja missions with
            boring and menial tasks. Weary and angry, Naruto vents his
            frustration at the Hokage. Amused by Naruto's excitement, he gives
            them a new mission, to protect a grumpy old man named Tazuna as he
            returns to his home!
