            &nbsp; While Naruto concentrates on the training to control his
            chakra, a mysterious person suddenly appears before him. The person
            tells Naruto that as long as one has the desire to protect what he
            loves, there is no limit to becoming stronger. The mysterious figure
            echoes the sentiment inside Naruto and the two feel a sense of
            connection.
