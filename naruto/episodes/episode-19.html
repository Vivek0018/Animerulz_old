            &nbsp; Zabuza is no longer Kakashi's enemy, and thanks to a little
            speech by Naruto about how ninja are, Zabuza takes on Gato's men
            single handily. The Demon of the Hidden Mist takes his vengeance on
            Gato and all of those dumb enough to follow him, and apologizes to
            Haku for what he did to the kind little boy. After the group takes
            care of the rest of Gato's men, Zabuza asks Kakashi one final
            request, to see Haku one final time. This is Zabuza's requiem.
